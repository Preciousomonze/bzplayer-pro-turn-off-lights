bzplayer-pro Turn Off the lights Wordpress Plugin
It adds a "turn off the light " feature when videos from bzplayer-pro plugin are played.
Also supports video elements in a div(or any element) that has a class named "video-js", i guess those are videos powered by video js.
Only supports the all videos with html5 video feature apart from videos from youtube,vimeo links embeded with iframe, tired of typing jare.
